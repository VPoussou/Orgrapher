So we need the 
    - Task class
    - Pseudo-root Task class
    - A way to display these MF
    - In the ui I want to be able to use timers for each task so I can track the time spent on each task and parent task
    - A way to save the state of these MF
Then to make this all more functional
    - A database and connection
    - Database modeling that fits my save state format (if not possible then change things up I guess)
    - Database saving
And then, well we'll see, but handling many users in database and shit
    - beep boop
