# Orgrapher
A minware implementation of my organization needs

Even though the name of the project contains **'graph'** it is actually tree based.

Purpose : This tool is made for project planning and management, with the initial implementation being
focused on project planning, additional functionalities being  dedicated to project management,
and further development including tools for milestone based evaluations of the different estimations that 
were generated during planning.

Paradigm : This tool is built to integrate two different but complimentary approaches to the evaluation of time needs for projects and their subparts.
    - The first is evaluating project time based on task difficulty related task time estimations
    - The second is evaluating task time based on the available time for the project and task difficulty estimations
This tool uses atomic tasks as an axiom. Which means that every project much be subdivided into its smallest possible components (how small is up to you and your team).
Although this tool is first and foremost built for my own needs, I'm all ears if you have different ideas.
